# Disclaimer
Flash USDT Sender is a tool for sending USDT quickly that lets users perform ETH and USDT flashing transactions with multiple variants of ETH (including USDT Fantom and Wrapped ETH) and USDT (ERC20, BEP20, and TRC20). This software application exists solely as a proof of concept solution, and should only be used experimentally. The setup and utilization is entirely dummyproof. Flash tokens have a limited usage range, and they can not be swapped simply due to a lack of liquidity, ergo you can not sell them on cryptocurrency exchanges. That simply does not exist. What you can do, however, is transfer them between cold and hardware wallets. Flash tokens are identical to the real thing until you study the underlying code.

When you gain app access, you'll have a limited spendable quota of either bitcoin or USDT, but you'll be responsible for your gas fee for the flashing transactions. You'll find a gas address in-app and the gas topup process is simple.
